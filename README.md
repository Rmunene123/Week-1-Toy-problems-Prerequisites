This solution has a folder called Project containing the three solutions to the required code challenge: 

 1. Gradegenerator.js
 2. Speeddetector.js
 3. Netcalculator.js

To run any of the solutions just (change directory) `cd` into the project folder and run any of them like `node Gradegenerator.js`

##  1. Grade generator
This function is used to calculate and return a grade based on a given mark input. It evaluates the mark using a switch statement and returns the  grade according to the requirements. This solution is contained in the `Gradegenerator.js file`.

## 2. Speed Detector
Based on criteria, the detectSpeed function calculates the speed effects of a vehicle. It records "Ok" if the speed is 70 km/h or less; demerit points are added for each 5 km/h exceeding 70 km/h; if the points total more than 12, the license is suspended. This solution is contained in the `Speeddetector.js`.

## 3. Net Calculator
The netSalaryCalculator function calculates an individual's net salary by calculating Tax, NHIF, and NSSF deductions from their gross salary . It calculates income tax, NHIF, and NSSF deductions, and then subtracts these amounts from the gross salary to obtain the net salary. This solution is contained in the `Netcalculator.js`.
